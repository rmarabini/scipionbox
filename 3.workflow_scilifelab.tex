\subsection{Swedish National CryoEM Facility}

\begin{verbatim}
We need to cover here differences with CNB setup
 CNB is a stand alone center. It does not work as a real National Facility
 SNC already had an application portal and Scipion needs to interact
 with it. 
 - initial script
 - same as CNB until session end
 - when acquisistion done contaCT PORTAL AND UPLOAD REPORT
