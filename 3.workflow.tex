\section{Processing with ScipionBox}

%Comment change in scale in the three examples: CNB, SNC and DIAMOND
%more local, SNC national, Diamond international. Portal infrastructure has
%different levels.

\scipion is a very flexible framework that allows to create many different workflows and to choose among several algorithms at each workflow-step. In this work we do not recommend a particular workflow 
over others since we realize that different specimens, microscopes or facilities may have different requirements. Nevertheless, since different use cases may clarify \scipionbox capabilities, in the following we describe the pipeline offered by default to the users of three different facilities where \scipion has been installed.
